So I decided to add a command line interface to my program. It runs in a
seperate thread and updates values in a shared memory segment. The stuff
in shared memory is a series of MAX_LIGHTS light structs.

All commands are on a single line

The grammar is as follows:

<object> <id> <property> [values...]

So to update the position of the first light we would say 

    light 0 position 50 50 50
    light 0 type 1 

For lights the properties are 

    * type in [0,1,2] - int
    * diffuse - vec3
    * specular - vec3
    * position - vec3
    * atten - vec3
    * direction - vec3
    * cutoff - float 
    * falloff - float
